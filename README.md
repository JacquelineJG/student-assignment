# Fun with Semantic Elements

This project is designed to help students learn how to properly use semantic elements in code.

## Assignment

This is a simple webpage that potrays information about the Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie.
This site is built almost entirely using the < div > tag.
Replace the tags using the semantic tags that make the most sense, without sacrificing the formatting.
Don't worry about the CSS: if the text size changes that's fine, focus on building a semantically correct webpage.

#### Stretch

If you complete this and would like to take your learning a bit further, try to examine the CSS and see what changes are made when you use certain semantic tags. Try to figure out how you can rework the CSS to keep the styling as intended. Look into CSS style resetting to learn more. Here's a good place to start: https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-reset

Here's what we see when we inspect:
